# Syre Developer Guide

Welcome to the Syre developer guide.

*How should I name my branch? What should I put in my commit message?*

These are the kind of questions this guide aims to answer.

## On branches

We use the branch name convention `type/description` (e.g. `feat/updated_ui`, `fix/compile-error`).

## On commits

If a commit fixes an issue, it should be mentioned in the commit message. For example:

`Fixes Issue #354`
